# Recommendations
Based on the observations, it was recommended that:
1.	The current economic level of majority of respondents are low. Thus, the government need to come up with workable policies that will usher-in the economic prosperity of Nigerian residents.
2.	People should be economically empowered in order to earn more legally and thus pay more taxes into the covers of governments.
3.	Palliative measures should be made available to the frustrated and/or jobless residents.
4.	Government should help in diversifying the economy in other for the residents to have more economic powers.  
5.	There should be provision of infrastructures for the residents. This will help the existing SMEs to grow and stimulate more other ones to be established.
6.	Nigerians spend most of their incomes on feeding, transportation and house rents. All these and many more social services should be subsidized by the government in order to lessen their costs on the residents.
